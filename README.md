# Clash Ninja - Calculate total upgrade time per building

- When calculating the upgrade costs and time, the Clash Ninja Progress Tracker lacks a feature: displaying total values for items that have multiple small upgrades. 
- Currently you can only see the bigger picture (total cost and time for each category, like defense, troops, resources), but if you want to know, say, how much time it will take to get all elixir collectors upgraded (not all collectors and storages from "resources" category), you will have a hard time estimating these values, because you can only see the cost and time for each small upgrade, but sometimes you have 5-15 upgrades, which takes time and resources... 
- This script calculates the total values for each individual building/troop that has more than one upgrade, so you can have a better overview before planning your upgrade priority.

### *As you can see, the site already shows the total cost and time for the category, but not for each item:*

When there are too many upgrades, it might not help.
